We've finally finished creating the createStore function! Using the image above as a guide, let's break down what we've accomplished:

we created a function called createStore() that returns a store object
createStore() must be passed a "reducer" function when invoked
the store object has three methods on it:
.getState() - used to get the current state from the store
.subscribe() - used to provide a listener function the store will call when the state changes
.dispatch() - used to make changes to the store's state
the store object's methods have access to the state of the store via closure
